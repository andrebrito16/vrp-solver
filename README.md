## Overview
This repository contains various implementations for solving the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) using different search techniques. The implementations are provided in C++, and there are accompanying Jupyter notebooks for generating input graphs and analyzing the results.

## Directory Structure

- **global-search/**: Contains the implementation using a global search technique.
- **global-search-mpi/**: Contains the MPI-based implementation of the global search.
- **global-search-omp/**: Contains the OpenMP-based implementation of the global search.
- **local-search/**: Contains the implementation using a local search technique.
- **local-search-mpi/**: Contains the MPI-based implementation of the local search.
- **local-search-omp/**: Contains the OpenMP-based implementation of the local search.
- **inputs/**: Contains various input graph files.
- **public/**: Contains the images for result analysis.
- **generate-report.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for generating the report.
- **graph-generator.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for generating input graphs.

## Installation
To compile and run the C++ implementations, navigate to the respective directory and use the provided `makefile`.

### Example for Global Search
```bash
cd global-search
make
./global_search
```

## Results:
Using the ipynb to generate reports for each strategy used to solve the VRP
problem.

The conclusion for this problem is that the global search is a strategy that always give the best results, but it is the most expensive in terms of time. The local search is a good strategy that gives good results and is faster than the global search. The local search with MPI is a good strategy that gives good results and is faster than the local search. The local search with OpenMP is a good strategy that gives good results and is faster than the local search with MPI.

The MPI strategy took a little bit more time in some cases, for example, when running for 7 cities, this is because the network latency to communicate between the nodes is higher than the time saved by the parallelism.
